A casual video game for Android Platform.

Bollywood
Bollywood is the informal term popularly used for the Hindi-language film industry. There are hundreds of hindi movies released every year in India. Each movie has interesting name. And it is equally interesting to note that Indians are obsessed with Bollywood and Bollywood movie names. They my not remember their dear ones birthday once but they might recall a bollywood movie name when quizzed(just joking :) ). So here is a casual game that i have developed which takes the inspiration from the Hangman game and emulates the earlier played with pen and paper game "Guess the Bollywood movie game" onto the PC and onto the Android enabled smart phones.
